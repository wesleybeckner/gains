========
GAINS - Genetic Algorithm for Identifying Novel Solvents - is a project
that enables molecular design and computational screening of ionic liquid
solvents for energy storage applications.

Built on the molecular functionality of RDKit, future versions of GAINS 
should be employable across a spectrum of small-molecule design problems.
