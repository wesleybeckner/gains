        GAINS
        ========
        Shablona is a template project for small scientific Python projects.
        
        It contains software implementations of an analysis of some simple data, but
        more importantly, it contains infrastructure for testing, documentation,
        continuous integration and deployment, which can be easily adapted
        to use in other projects.
        
        To get started using these components in your own software, please go to the
        repository README_.
