        GAINS
        ========
        GAINS - Genetic Algorithm for Identifying Novel Solvents - is a project
        that enables molecular design and computational screening of ionic liquid
        solvents for energy storage applications.
        
        Built on the molecular functionality of RDKit, future versions of GAINS 
        should be employable across a spectrum of small-molecule design problems.
