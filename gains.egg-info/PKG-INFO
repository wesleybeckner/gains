        GAINS
        ========
        GAINS - Genetic Algorithm for Identifying Novel Structures - is a project
        that enables molecular design and computational screening of
        small molecules--in particular solvents--for energy storage applications.
        
        Built on the molecular functionality of RDKit, future versions of GAINS
        should be employable across a spectrum of small-molecule design problems.
